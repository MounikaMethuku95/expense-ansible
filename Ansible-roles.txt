Ansible.cfg:
--> The packages we install using dnf, all have their config stored under /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

Preferences for ansible config:
1. ANSIBLE_CONFIG (environment variable if set)
2. ansible.cfg (in the current directory)
3. ~/.ansible.cfg (in the home directory)
4. /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

** IN general, the config file is managed in the current directory. It will be easy to manage project wise.

Ansible Roles:
--> DRY - don't repeat yourself
->code reuse
-> A standard structure of writing playbooks that contain tasks, vars, templates, dependencies, files, libraries etc.,

roles/role-name

tasks --> You can keep all your tasks here, ansible automatically loads them
	main.yaml 
vars --> variables required for this role
	main.yaml
templates --> you can keep variables in the file, ansible replace the value at runtime.
	any file
files --> We can keep files in this folder
	any file names
Handlers --> notifiers when some change event is happened
defaults/         #
	main.yml      #  <-- default lower priority variables for this role
meta  --> dependencies of this role
	main.yaml
library/          # roles can also include custom modules
